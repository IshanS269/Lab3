        <h2>Daddy Day Care</h2>
        <p>Daddy Day Care is a movie about a dad who goes from working at a normal desk job to becoming a day care centre worker for his son. His son tries to go to private school but it ends up being too expensive so his dad and his friend start running a day care centre. People find out that it isn't legal but they end up making it legal so everyone can pay cheaper prices to have day care and for their children to have fun.</p>
        <p>I enjoy watching this move a lot because it reminds me of when I used to be home and stay with my dad who worked from home. I also watched the movie for the first time with him so it made it that much better.</p>
        <p>This movie is for all ages and anyone can watch it which makes it accessible for all!</p>
